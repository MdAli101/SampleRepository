push = giving codes in gitHub
pull = taking codes from gitHub to our computer

Push an existing repository from the command line
    git remote add origin https://github.com/MdAli101/GitTutorialHub.git

    here git will remote add this link as the name of origin

checking url(s):
    git remote -v
    it will show 2 url one for pull and one for push.

pushing codes:
    git push -u origin main
    This is the code to push your codes in git hub but for first time it wont allow
    you to push codes because in this way a squickward will also push push codes
    on your github account

so check my docs on the "Making remote and ssh key" in it's parent folder.
and create your own key

than u'll have that
